<title>GTK+ on Wayland</title>

<h1><a href="/"><img src="wayland.png" alt="Wayland logo"></a></h1>
<h1>GTK+</h1>
<p>GTK+ is a multi platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces. It
has a large range of widgets available for the user all driven through a
centralised theme system.</p>

<p><strong>The GTK+ backend is under active continuous development - currently you
  should only attempt to use it if you are experienced with GTK+.</strong></p>

<div id="generated-toc" class="generate_from_h2"></div>

<h2>Getting the source</h2>

<p>For correct functionality with current Wayland you must use the GTK+ master
branch. As a precursor to these steps you must have downloaded and compiled
Wayland as per the <a href="/building.html">building instructions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>GTK+ master also currently depends on an unstable release version of
glib and atk. To avoid problems it is advisable to install this into the prefix used
in the <a href="/building.html">Wayland build instructions</a>.</strong></p>

<pre>
$ git clone git://git.gnome.org/glib
$ git clone git://git.gnome.org/atk
$ git clone git://git.gnome.org/gtk+
</pre>

<h2>Compiling GTK+ and its dependencies</h2>

<p>This section depends on the environment variables defined in the
<a href="/building.html">build instructions</a> being set. </p>

<h3>glib</h3>
<pre>
$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD
$ make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<h3>atk</h3>
<pre>
$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD
$ make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<h3>gtk</h3>
<pre>
$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD --enable-wayland-backend
$ make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<p>The configure scripts may report some missing packages. Install these from
source or from your distribution.</p>

<h2>Trying it out</h2>

<p>The GTK+ source tree includes some test programs that you can
run to check functionality. If you have configured with multiple backends then
you should make sure to set the following environment variable.</p>

<pre>export GDK_BACKEND=wayland</pre>

<p>Inside the <code>tests</code> tests directory are some standalone test
programs for various pieces of widget functionality. A more comprehensive tool
for testing is <code>demo/gtk-demo/gtk3-demo</code> which provides a UI for
selecting various widgets to play with. The screenshot below shows what the
demo application looks like.</p>

<h2>Porting your GTK+ application</h2>

<p>The GTK+ port to Wayland has some major functionality gaps. Porting of
applications at this stage should simply be to start identifying where
applications makes API calls that will not function under Wayland.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure that your application uses <code>gtk+-3.0</code> for its
  pkg-config request.</li>
  <li>All calls to the gdk_x11_ namespace
  and raw Xlib calls must be wrapped in <a
  href="http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.3/ch24s02.html#id1502079">both
  build-time and run-time backend checks</a>.</li>
  <li>Check the errata below for issues that might affect your
  application.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Client side decorations are available in the the master branch but not
  in 3.8 or older.</li>
  <li>Copy and paste functionality is implemented however there may be certain
  cases that do not work - please report these in the bug tracking system</li>
  <li>Drag and drop is not implemented.</li>
  <li>Popup menus appear but may not have the correct grab behavior and are not
  positioned in the correct location.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting help and reporting issues</h2>

<p>Try the #gtk+ IRC channel on irc.gimp.org or if you've found a bug you
can report it in <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=gtk+">GNOME Bugzilla</a>.</p>
