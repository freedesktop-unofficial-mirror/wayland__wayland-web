Building Weston</h1>

<p>The instructions below assume some familiarity with git and
building and running experimental software.  Also, be prepared for the fact that this
project is still very much a prototype.  When the instructions suggest to clone a git repo, you can
of course just add a remote and fetch instead, if you have a clone of
that repo around already.</p>

<h2>Hardware / Drivers</h2>

<p>X output requires DRI2.  DRM output (without X) requires Kernel Mode
Setting (KMS) and the page flip ioctl.  These are supported by:</p>

<p><b>Intel</b>: i915 (June 2004) or newer cards.  DRM support has been
in the kernel since around 2.6.29.  Sandy Bridge chips require kernel
2.6.37.</p>

<p><b>AMD/ATI</b>: Requires open source driver (radeon/ati,
not fglrx/catalyst).  DRM output requires kernel version 2.6.38.
Cards probably work back to Radeon 7200 (2000).</p>

<p><b>nVidia</b>: Requires Nouveau (open source driver).  DRM output
<a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55596">requires
kernel version 3.7-rc3</a>.  DRM output previously required kernel
version 2.6.37 for nv40 or lower cards, 2.6.38 for nv50 cards. Some new
cards require
<a href="http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/InstallDRM#Firmware">loading
external firmware</a>.</p>

Pi</a>, see <a href="raspberrypi.html">Raspberry Pi build guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="environment">Setting up the environment</h2>
<h3>Installing in a custom location</h3>
<p>If you do not want to install system wide, you'll need to set
the following environment variables to get various libraries to link
appropriately:</p>

<pre>
export WLD=$HOME/install   <span class="comment"># change this to another location if you prefer</span>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$WLD/lib
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$WLD/lib/pkgconfig/:$WLD/share/pkgconfig/
export PATH=$WLD/bin:$PATH
export ACLOCAL_PATH=$WLD/share/aclocal
export ACLOCAL="aclocal -I $ACLOCAL_PATH"

mkdir -p $WLD/share/aclocal <span class="comment"># needed by autotools</span>
</pre>

<p>Do not set LD_LIBRARY_PATH as your default, it will break things.</p>
<p>You may put the above in a script and source it in the terminal
you wish to build the packages.</p>

<h3>Installing system wide</h3>

<p>To install system wide, you'll need to set WLD differently, add
some switches to every autogen.sh invocation, and use sudo to make
install. Choose the libdir as appropriate for your distribution and
architecture (32 vs. 64 bit).</p>

<pre>
export WLD=/usr
...
./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD --libdir=/usr/lib --sysconfdir=/etc
make
sudo make install
...
</pre>

<h2>Wayland libraries</h2>

<p>This is required in order to be able to build Mesa with
--with-egl-platforms=x11,wayland,drm.</p>

<pre>
$ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland
$ cd wayland
$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD
$ make &amp;&amp; make install
$ cd ..
</pre>

<h2>Mesa</h2>

<p>Wayland uses the mesa EGL stack, and all extensions required to run
EGL on KMS are now upstream.  Wayland should work with any mesa
release after 9.0, but in some cases extra functionality or
optimization will only be available in more recent releases.</p>

<p>To compile mesa you'll need a development package for libdrm.
Other dependencies are development packages of xcb-dri2 and
xcb-xfixes.</p>

<pre>
$ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa
$ cd mesa
$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD --enable-gles2 --disable-gallium-egl \
  --with-egl-platforms=x11,wayland,drm --enable-gbm --enable-shared-glapi \
  --with-gallium-drivers=r300,r600,swrast,nouveau
$ make &amp;&amp; make install
$ cd ..
</pre>

<p>We disable Gallium for Intel 915 and 965, which just means that libEGL
won't try to load the Gallium drivers directly.  The Gallium drivers will
be built as DRI drivers, which the EGL loader will load just fine.</p>

<p><a href="mesa-configure.html">Example mesa configure output.</a></p>

<p>Note on Mesa build failures:  If you're not building in your Mesa git
repo for the first time, the first thing to try is always "<code>git&nbsp;clean&nbsp;-xfd</code>", and possibly deleting your $WLD directory, as Mesa requires
this often.</p>

<h2>libunwind</h2>

<p>Weston requires libunwind v1.1 if you don't configure with
--disable-libunwind .</p>

<pre>
$ git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/libunwind
$ cd libunwind
$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure --prefix=$WLD
$ make &amp;&amp; make install
$ cd ..
</pre>

<h2>libinput</h2>

<p>Libinput translates evdev events into Wayland events. It has been split
from Weston as the code is reusable by any Wayland compositor on Linux.</p>

<pre>
$ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/wayland/libinput
$ cd libinput
$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD
$ make &amp;&amp; make install
$ cd ..
</pre>

<h2><code>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code></h2>

<p>Weston creates its unix socket file (for example, wayland-0)
in the directory specified by the required environment variable
<code>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code> . Clients use the same variable to find that
socket. This is provided using systemd by some distributions (Fedora,
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/news/systemd-tools-replaces-udev/">Arch
since June 2012</a> or Exherbo).
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pam-xdg-support/+bug/894391">Ubuntu began providing it in Quantal.</a>
It is not provided by Gentoo.
</p>
<p>
If you are using a distro that does set <code>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code> for you,
you can skip this part. Otherwise, you must set it using your shell profile
capability.
</p>
<p>
First, please read your shell manual to use the correct file. Some shells will
read multiple files (Zshell), others will pick the first available one ignoring
the others (Bash). <code>~/.profile</code> is generally a good guess, for most
Bourne-shell compatible shells, <code>~/.zprofile</code> is the Zshell
equivalent. You should use the profile file if there is any, otherwise the
login file will do the trick.
</p>
<p>
We will use <code>/tmp</code> as the base to put our
<code>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code> in. Since <code>/tmp</code> can be a tmpfs, and
thus wiped on restart, we should take care of creating it when we need it. Also,
if you share your computer between several users, you must take care of using a
unique <code>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code> for each one. We will also check if the
variable is already set. This way, if your system starts providing it, you will
use it directly. It is also useful if you want to use your profile file on
different systems.
<br>
Here is the code to put in your shell profile file (it is Bourne-shell
compatible, feel free to adapt it to your shellâ€™s internals):
</p>

<pre>
if test -z "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"; then
    export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/${UID}-runtime-dir
    if ! test -d "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"; then
        mkdir "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"
        chmod 0700 "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"
    fi
fi
</pre>


<h2>Weston and demo applications</h2>

<p>Weston is the reference implementation of a Wayland compositor.
It's available in the weston repo and comes with a few demo
applications.

<p>Aside from mesa and libxkbcommon, the Weston dependencies can be
satisfied with released versions of:

gdk-pixbuf-2.0,
libudev 136,
libdrm 2.4.23,
pixman-1,
cairo-gl 1.11.3,
glib-2.0, and
gobject-2.0.  
</p>

<pre>
$ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston
$ cd weston
$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD --enable-libinput-backend
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ cd ..
</pre>

<p>If DISPLAY is set, the weston will run under X in a window and take
input from X.  Otherwise it will run on the KMS framebuffer and take input
from evdev devices.  Copy the weston.ini config file to ~/.config and
edit it to set a background image that you like.  Then run the compositor
by typing:</p>

<pre>
$ weston
</pre>

<p>For KMS/DRM output (outside of X) use weston-launch, which needs
root permissions.  It also requires that you enable
systemd session support for weston-launch (by using systemd and having
the systemd-login devel headers at configure time) or add yourself to the
"weston-launch" group:</p>

<pre>
$ sudo groupadd weston-launch
$ sudo usermod -a -G weston-launch $USER
$ <span class="comment"># Log all the way out (of X, etc.)</span>
$ sudo chown root $WLD/bin/weston-launch
$ sudo chmod +s $WLD/bin/weston-launch
$ weston-launch
</pre>

<p>To run clients, switch to a different VT and run the client from
there.  Or run it under X and start up the clients from a terminal
window.  There are a few demo clients available in the weston build
directory, but they are all
pretty simple and mostly for testing specific features in the wayland
protocol: </p>

<ul>
  <li>'weston-terminal' is a simple terminal emulator, not very compliant at all,
    but works well enough for bash</li>
  <li>'weston-flower' draws a flower on the screen, testing the frame
    protocol</li>
  <li>'weston-gears' glxgears, but for wayland</li>
  <li>'weston-smoke' tests SHM buffer sharing</li>
  <li>'weston-image' loads the image files passed on the command line and
    shows them</li>
  <li>'weston-view' does the same for pdf files</li>
  <li>'weston-resizor' demonstrates smooth window resizing
    (use up and down keys)</li>
  <li>'weston-eventdemo' reports libtoytoolkit's 
    events to console (see weston-eventdemo --help)</li>
</ul>
