<p>The instructions below assume some familiarity with git and
building and running experimental software.  And be prepared that this
project isn't at all useful right now, it's still very much a
prototype.  When the instructions suggest to clone a git repo, you can
of course just add a remote and fetch instead, if you have a clone of
that repo around already.  By default the software is installed in $HOME/install
but you can change it by altering $WLD (explained later). You can also install
everything system wide by setting WLD to /usr and passing --sysconfdir=/etc
to autogen.sh.</p>

<h2>Hardware / Drivers</h2>

<p>X output requires DRI2.  DRM output (without X) requires Kernel Mode
Setting (KMS) and the page flip ioctl.  These are supported by:</p>

<p><b>Intel</b>: i915 (June 2004) or newer cards.  DRM support has been
in the kernel since around 2.6.29.  Sandy Bridge chips require kernel
2.6.37.</p>

<p><b>AMD/ATI</b>: Requires open source driver (radeon/ati,
not fglrx/catalyst).  DRM output requires kernel version 2.6.38.
Cards probably work back to Radeon 7200 (2000).</p>

<p><b>nVidia</b>: Requires Nouveau (open source driver).  DRM output
requires kernel version 2.6.37 for nv40 or lower cards, 2.6.38 for nv50
cards. NVC0 / Fermi chips, release March 2010, require loading external
firmware, which is documented
<a href="http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/NVC0_Firmware">here</a></p>

<h2>Setting up the environment</h2>
<p>If you want to install in a custom location (not system wide), you'll need
to set the following environment variables to get various libraries to link
appropriately:</p>

<pre>WLD=$HOME/install   # change this to another location if you prefer
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$WLD/lib
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$WLD/lib/pkgconfig/:$WLD/share/pkgconfig/
ACLOCAL="aclocal -I $WLD/share/aclocal"

export WLD LD_LIBRARY_PATH PKG_CONFIG_PATH ACLOCAL
</pre>

<p>Do not set LD_LIBRARY_PATH as your default, it will break things.</p>
<p>You may put the above in a script and source it in the terminal
you wish to build the packages.</p>

<h2>Wayland libraries</h2>

<p>Required to build Mesa with --with-egl-platforms=x11,wayland,drm.</p>

<pre>    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland
    $ cd wayland
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD
    $ make
    $ make install
</pre>

<h2>Mesa</h2>

<p>Wayland uses the mesa EGL stack, and all extensions required to run
EGL on KMS are now upstream on the master branch.  You'll need to pull
it from git, because 7.10 does not include required commits related to
BGRA8888 and wayland-egl.  For this you'll also need a development
package for libdrm.
Other dependencies are development packages of xcb-dri2 and xcb-xfixes.</p>

<pre>    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/mesa/drm
    $ cd drm
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD --enable-nouveau-experimental-api
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install

    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/xorg/util/macros
    $ cd macros
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install

    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/glproto
    $ cd glproto
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install

    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/dri2proto
    $ cd dri2proto
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install

    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa
    $ cd mesa
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD --enable-gles2 --disable-gallium-egl \
      --with-egl-platforms=x11,wayland,drm --enable-gbm --enable-shared-glapi
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<p>We disable Gallium for Intel 915 and 965, which just means that libEGL
won't try to load the Gallium drivers directly.  The Gallium drivers will
be built as DRI drivers, which the EGL loader will load just fine.</p>


<h2>libxkbcommon</h2>

<p>Wayland needs libxkbcommon for translating evdev keycodes to
keysyms.  For this you'll need development packages for xproto,
kbproto, macros and libX11.</p>

<pre>    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/xorg/util/macros
    $ cd macros
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install

    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/xproto
    $ cd xproto
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install

    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/kbproto
    $ cd kbproto
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install

    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libX11
    $ cd libX11
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install

    $ git clone git://people.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libxkbcommon.git
    $ cd libxkbcommon/
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD --with-xkb-config-root=/usr/share/X11/xkb
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<h2>cairo-gl</h2>

<p>The Wayland clients can render using cairo-gl, but fall back to
software when cairo-gl is not available.  cairo-gl is an experimental
cairo backend and has been available since cairo 1.10, but recent
bugfixes (available in non-released 1.11.3) are needed.
Thus cairo from git is required.
For this you'll need a development package for pixman.</p>

<pre>    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/pixman
    $ cd pixman
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install

    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/cairo
    $ cd cairo
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD --enable-gl --enable-xcb
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<h2>Weston and demo applications</h2>

<p>Weston is the reference implementation of a Wayland compositor.
It's available in the weston repo and comes with a few demo
applications.

<p>Aside from mesa and libxkbcommon, the Weston dependencies can be
satisfied with released versions of:

gdk-pixbuf-2.0,
libudev 136,
libdrm 2.4.23,
pixman-1,
cairo-gl 1.11.3,
glib-2.0, and
gobject-2.0.  
And optionally, for the pdf viewer:
poppler-glib and
gio-2.0.</p>

<pre>    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston
    $ cd weston
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD
    $ make
    $ make install
</pre>

<p>If DISPLAY is set, the weston will run under X in a window and take
input from X.  Otherwise it will run on the KMS framebuffer and take
input from evdev devices.  Copy the weston-deskop-shell.ini config
file to ~/.config and edit it to set a background image that you
like.  The run the compositor by typing</p>

<pre>    $ ./weston
</pre>

<p>To run clients, switch to a different VT and run the client from
there.  Or run it under X and start up the clients from a terminal
window.  There are a few demo clients available, but they are all
pretty simple and mostly for testing specific features in the wayland
protocol: </p>

<ul>
  <li>'terminal' is a simple terminal emulator, not very compliant at all,
    but works well enough for bash</li>
  <li>'flower' draws a flower on the screen, testing the frame
    protocol</li>
  <li>'gears' glxgears, but for wayland</li>
  <li>'smoke' tests SHM buffer sharing</li>
  <li>'image' loads the image files passed on the command line and
    shows them</li>
  <li>'view' does the same for pdf files</li>
  <li>'resizor' demonstrates smooth window resizing
    (use up and down keys)</li>
  <li>'eventdemo' reports libtoytoolkit's 
    events to console (see eventdemo --help)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Environment variables which will get you more debugging output:</p>

<pre>MESA_DEBUG=1
EGL_LOG_LEVEL=debug
LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose
WAYLAND_DEBUG=1
</pre>
