<p>The instructions below assume some familiarity with git and
building and running experimental software.  Also, be prepared for the fact that this
project isn't at all useful right now, it's still very much a
prototype.  When the instructions suggest to clone a git repo, you can
of course just add a remote and fetch instead, if you have a clone of
that repo around already.  By default the software is installed in $HOME/install
but you can change it by altering $WLD (explained later). You can also install
everything system-wide by setting WLD to /usr and passing --sysconfdir=/etc
to autogen.sh.</p>

<h2>Hardware / Drivers</h2>

<p>X output requires DRI2.  DRM output (without X) requires Kernel Mode
Setting (KMS) and the page flip ioctl.  These are supported by:</p>

<p><b>Intel</b>: i915 (June 2004) or newer cards.  DRM support has been
in the kernel since around 2.6.29.  Sandy Bridge chips require kernel
2.6.37.</p>

<p><b>AMD/ATI</b>: Requires open source driver (radeon/ati,
not fglrx/catalyst).  DRM output requires kernel version 2.6.38.
Cards probably work back to Radeon 7200 (2000).</p>

<p><b>nVidia</b>: Requires Nouveau (open source driver).  DRM output
<a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55596">requires
kernel version 3.7-rc3</a>.  DRM output previously required kernel
version 2.6.37 for nv40 or lower cards, 2.6.38 for nv50 cards. Some new
cards require
<a href="http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/InstallDRM#Firmware">loading
external firmware</a>.</p>

<p>For building Weston for <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry
Pi</a>, see <a href="raspberrypi.html">Raspberry Pi build guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Setting up the environment</h2>
<h3>Installing in a custom location</h3>
<p>If you do not want to install system wide, you'll need to set
the following environment variables to get various libraries to link
appropriately:</p>

<pre>WLD=$HOME/install   # change this to another location if you prefer
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$WLD/lib
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$WLD/lib/pkgconfig/:$WLD/share/pkgconfig/
ACLOCAL="aclocal -I $WLD/share/aclocal"

export WLD LD_LIBRARY_PATH PKG_CONFIG_PATH ACLOCAL
</pre>

<p>Do not set LD_LIBRARY_PATH as your default, it will break things.</p>
<p>You may put the above in a script and source it in the terminal
you wish to build the packages.</p>

<h3>Installing system wide</h3>
<p>To install system wide, you'll need to set this variable, and possibly
build with --libdir=/usr/lib64 :</p>

<pre>WLD=/usr
export WLD
</pre>

<h2>Wayland libraries</h2>

<p>This is required in order to be able to build Mesa with
--with-egl-platforms=x11,wayland,drm.</p>

<pre>    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland
    $ cd wayland
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD
    $ make
    $ make install
</pre>

<h2>Mesa</h2>

<p>Wayland uses the mesa EGL stack, and all extensions required to run EGL
on KMS are now upstream on the master branch.  Wayland master requires
mesa master.  Wayland 0.85 works with mesa branch 8.0 and master.
For this you'll also need a development package for libdrm.  Other
dependencies are development packages of xcb-dri2 and xcb-xfixes.</p>

<pre>    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/mesa/drm
    $ cd drm
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install

    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa
    $ cd mesa
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD --enable-gles2 --disable-gallium-egl \
      --with-egl-platforms=x11,wayland,drm --enable-gbm --enable-shared-glapi \
      --with-gallium-drivers=r300,r600,swrast,nouveau
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<p>We disable Gallium for Intel 915 and 965, which just means that libEGL
won't try to load the Gallium drivers directly.  The Gallium drivers will
be built as DRI drivers, which the EGL loader will load just fine.</p>

<p><a href="mesa-configure.html">Example mesa configure output.</a></p>

<p>Note on Mesa build failures:  If you're not building in your Mesa git
repo for the first time, the first thing to try is always "git clean
-xfd", and possibly deleting your $WLD directory, as Mesa requires
this often.</p>

<h2>libxkbcommon</h2>

<p>Wayland needs libxkbcommon for translating evdev keycodes to keysyms.
For wayland 0.85 use libxkbcommon branch for-weston-0.85.  For this you'll
need a development packages for macros.</p>


<pre>    $ git clone git://people.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libxkbcommon.git
    $ cd libxkbcommon/
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD --with-xkb-config-root=/usr/share/X11/xkb
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<h2>cairo-gl</h2>

<p>The Wayland clients can render using cairo-gl, but fall back to
software when cairo-gl is not available.  cairo-gl is an experimental
cairo backend and has been available since cairo 1.10, but recent
bug fixes (available in non-released 1.11.3) are needed.
Thus cairo from git is required.
For this you'll need a development package for pixman.</p>

<pre>    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/pixman
    $ cd pixman
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install

    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/cairo
    $ cd cairo
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD --enable-gl --enable-xcb
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<h2>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</h2>

<p>Weston creates its unix socket file (for example, wayland-0)
in the directory specified by the required environment variable
$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR .  Clients use the same variable to find that socket.
This is provided by Fedora using systemd.  
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pam-xdg-support/+bug/894391">Ubuntu began providing it in Quantal.</a>
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/news/systemd-tools-replaces-udev/">Arch began providing it with systemd in June 2012.</a>
It is not provided by Gentoo.</p>

<pre>    $ export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/
</pre>

<h2>Weston and demo applications</h2>

<p>Weston is the reference implementation of a Wayland compositor.
It's available in the weston repo and comes with a few demo
applications.

<p>Aside from mesa and libxkbcommon, the Weston dependencies can be
satisfied with released versions of:

gdk-pixbuf-2.0,
libudev 136,
libdrm 2.4.23,
pixman-1,
cairo-gl 1.11.3,
glib-2.0, and
gobject-2.0.  
And optionally, for the pdf viewer:
poppler-glib and
gio-2.0.</p>

<pre>    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston
    $ cd weston
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD
    $ make
    $ make install
</pre>

<p>If DISPLAY is set, the weston will run under X in a window and take
input from X.  Otherwise it will run on the KMS framebuffer and take input
from evdev devices.  Copy the weston.ini config file to ~/.config and
edit it to set a background image that you like.  Then run the compositor
by typing:</p>

<pre>    $ ./weston
</pre>

<p>For KMS/DRM output weston needs root permissions.  You can accomplish
this by making weston SUID root (<tt>sudo chown root weston; sudo chmod
+s weston</tt>) or, with weston master, using weston-launch, which also
requires SUID root, only works outside of X, and requires that you enable
systemd session support for weston-launch (how?) or add yourself to the
"weston-launch" group:</p>

<pre>    $ sudo groupadd weston-launch
    $ sudo usermod -a -G weston-launch $USER
    $ # Log all the way out (of X, etc.)
    $ sudo chown root weston-launch
    $ sudo chmod +s weston-launch
    $ weston-launch
</pre>

<p>To run clients, switch to a different VT and run the client from
there.  Or run it under X and start up the clients from a terminal
window.  There are a few demo clients available, but they are all
pretty simple and mostly for testing specific features in the wayland
protocol: </p>

<ul>
  <li>'terminal' is a simple terminal emulator, not very compliant at all,
    but works well enough for bash</li>
  <li>'flower' draws a flower on the screen, testing the frame
    protocol</li>
  <li>'gears' glxgears, but for wayland</li>
  <li>'smoke' tests SHM buffer sharing</li>
  <li>'image' loads the image files passed on the command line and
    shows them</li>
  <li>'view' does the same for pdf files</li>
  <li>'resizor' demonstrates smooth window resizing
    (use up and down keys)</li>
  <li>'eventdemo' reports libtoytoolkit's 
    events to console (see eventdemo --help)</li>
</ul>
