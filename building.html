<p>The instructions below assume some familiarity with git and
building and running experimental software.  And be prepared that this
project isn't at all useful right now, it's still very much a
prototype.  When the instructions suggest to clone a git repo, you can
of course just add a remote and fetch instead, if you have a clone of
that repo around already.  I usually install all software I'm working
on into $HOME/install, so that's what I'll use in the instructions
below, but you can use your favorite directory of course or install
over your system copy (pass --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc,
generally).</p>

<h2>Setting up the environment</h2>
<p>If you want to install in $HOME/install (or another location that won't
interfere with the rest of your system) you'll need to set the following
environment variables to get various libraries to link appropriately:</p>

<pre>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/install/lib
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/install/lib/pkgconfig/:$HOME/install/share/pkgconfig/
ACLOCAL="aclocal -I $HOME/install/share/aclocal"
C_INCLUDE_PATH=$HOME/install/include
LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/install/lib
</pre>

<p>Do not set LD_LIBRARY_PATH as your default, it will break things.</p>

<h2>Modesetting</h2>

<p>At this point, kernel modesetting is upstream for Intel, ATI/AMD and
nVidia chipsets.  Most distributions ship with kernel modesetting
enabled by default and will work with Wayland out of the box.  The
modesetting driver must also support the page flip ioctl, which only
the Intel driver does at this point.</p>


<h2>Building mesa without Wayland EGL platform</h2>

<p>Wayland uses the mesa EGL stack, and all extensions required to run
EGL on KMS are now upstream on the master branch.  You'll need to pull
it from git, because 7.10 does not include required commits related to
BGRA8888 and wayland-egl.  First build it without the Wayland EGL
platform, because the libraries that requires are not yet installed.
For this you'll also need a development package for libdrm.</p>

<pre>    
    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/mesa/drm
    $ cd drm
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME/install --enable-nouveau-experimental-api
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install

    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa
    $ cd mesa
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME/install --enable-gles2                   \
      --disable-gallium-egl --enable-gallium-nouveau --enable-gallium-r600
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<p>We disable Gallium for Intel 915 and 965, which just means that libEGL
won't try to load the Gallium drivers directly.  The Gallium drivers will
be built as DRI drivers, which the EGL loader will load just fine.</p>


<h2>libxkbcommon</h2>

<p>Wayland needs libxkbcommon for translating evdev keycodes to
keysyms.  For this you'll need development packages for xproto,
kbproto, macros and libX11.</p>

<pre>    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/xproto
    $ cd xproto
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME/install
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install

    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/kbproto
    $ cd kbproto
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME/install
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install

    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/xorg/util/macros
    $ cd macros
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME/install
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install

    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libX11
    $ cd libX11
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME/install
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install

    $ git clone git://people.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libxkbcommon.git
    $ cd libxkbcommon/
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME/install --with-xkb-config-root=/usr/share/X11/xkb
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<h2>cairo-gl</h2>

<p>The Wayland clients can render using cairo-gl, but fall back to
software when cairo-gl is not available.  cairo-gl is an experimental
cairo backend and has been available since cairo 1.10.  Unless your
distribution ships cairo with the gl backend enabled, you'll need to
compile your own version of cairo.  For this you'll need a development
package for pixman.</p>

<pre>    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/pixman
    $ cd pixman
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME/install
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install

    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/cairo
    $ cd cairo
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME/install --enable-gl --enable-xcb
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<h2>Wayland libraries</h2>

<p>With mesa and libxkbcommon in place, we can checkout and build Wayland.
Aside from mesa, Wayland may need development packages for gdk-pixbuf-2.0,
libudev, libdrm, xcb-dri2, xcb-fixes (for X compositor) cairo-gl,
glib-2.0, gdk-2.0 (for poppler) and poppler-glib.  To satisfy mesa
dependencies, first install just the libraries:</p>

<pre>    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/wayland
    $ cd wayland
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME/install
    $ make -C wayland/ install
</pre>

<h2>Building mesa with Wayland EGL platform</h2>

<p>Build mesa a second time, adding --with-egl-platforms (wayland must
come first).</p>

<pre>    $ cd mesa
    $ make realclean # Otherwise important stuff doesn't get rebuilt.
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME/install --enable-gles2                   \
      --disable-gallium-egl --enable-gallium-nouveau --enable-gallium-r600 \
      --with-egl-platforms=wayland,drm
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<h2>Wayland applications</h2>

<p>Now install the rest of wayland.</p>

<pre>    $ cd wayland
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME/install
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<p>Installing into a non-/usr prefix is fine, but the 70-wayland.rules
udev rule file has to be copied to /etc/udev/rules.d.</p>

<pre>    $ sudo cp compositor/70-wayland.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
</pre>

<p>Once installed, either reboot or run the following to make udev label
the devices wayland will use.</p>

<pre>    $ sudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=drm --subsystem-match=input
</pre>

<p>If DISPLAY is set, the wayland compositor will run under X in a
window and take input from X.  Otherwise it will run on the KMS
framebuffer and take input from evdev devices.  Pick a background
image that you like and copy it to the Wayland source directory as
background.jpg or use the -b command line option:</p>

<pre>    $ ./compositor -b my-image.jpg
</pre>

<p>To run clients, switch to a different VT and run the client from
there.  Or run it under X and start up the clients from a terminal
window.  There are a few demo clients available, but they are all
pretty simple and mostly for testing specific features in the wayland
protocol: </p>

<ul>
  <li>'terminal' is a simple terminal emulator, not very compliant at all,
    but works well enough for bash</li>
  <li>'flower' draws a flower on the screen, testing the frame
    protocol</li>
  <li>'gears' glxgears, but for wayland</li>
  <li>'smoke' tests SHM buffer sharing</li>
  <li>'image' loads the image files passed on the command line and
    shows them</li>
  <li>'view' does the same for pdf files</li>
  <li>'resizor' demonstrates smooth window resizing
    (use up and down keys)</li>
  <li>'eventdemo' reports libtoytoolkit's 
    events to console (see eventdemo --help)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Environment variables which will get you more debugging output:</p>

<pre>MESA_DEBUG=1
EGL_LOG_LEVEL=debug
LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose
WAYLAND_DEBUG=1
