<p>Before trying to compile and run any of the toolkits below, keep in
mind that they're all in progress and at most at the prototype stage.
And Wayland is still in development and the API and the core protocol
is still changing.  We try to keep things up to date, but you're
likely run into breakage.</p>

<h2>Qt 5</h2>

<p>Wayland support in the Qt 5 toolkit is happening in the Lighthouse wayland
plugin. To try it out check <a href="qt5.html">Qt 5 Wayland instructions</a>.</p>

<h2>GTK+</h2>

<p>With GTK+ 3.0, GTK+ gained support for multiple backends at runtime and can
switch between backends in the same way Qt can with lighthouse. The Wayland
support is on the upstream GTK+ master branch but disabled by default. You can
find full details in the <a href="gtk.html">GTK Wayland instructions</a>.</p>

<h2>Clutter</h2>

<p>The Clutter toolkit has a Wayland backend that allows it to run as a
Wayland client. The backend is in the master branch of the upstream repository. You
can find full details in the <a href="clutter.html">Clutter Wayland instructions</a>.</p>

<h2>SDL</h2>

<p>Benjamin Franzke is working on a port of SDL to Wayland, it's
available in
his <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~bnf/sdl-wayland/">sdl-wayland
repo</a> on freedesktop.org.</p>

<h2>EFL</h2>

<p>EFL is currently being ported to Wayland, according to the developer
(Christopher Michael aka devilhorns); everything but E17 works at this time.
Please see <a href="http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/wiki/Wayland">here</a> for
details.</p>
