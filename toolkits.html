<p>Before trying to compile and run any of the toolkits below, keep in
mind that they're all in progress and at most at the prototype stage.
And Wayland is still in development and the API and the core protocol
is still changing.  We try to keep things up to date, but you're
likely run into breakage.  Also, remember that you typically will have
to set <code>EGL_PLATFORM=wayland</code>.</p>

<h2>Qt</h2>

<p>Wayland support in the Qt toolkit is happening in
the <a href="https://gitorious.org/+qt-developers/qt/lighthouse">Qt
lighthouse repo</a>.
The <a href="http://labs.qt.nokia.com/category/labs/lighthouse/">lighthouse</a>
project is an effort to make it easier to port Qt to new window
systems and the Wayland support is a plugin to lighthouse.  To try it
out, clone the lighthouse repo and pass -qpa to configure to select
the lighthouse platform:</p>

<pre>$ git clone git://gitorious.org/+qt-developers/qt/lighthouse.git
$ cd lighthouse
$ ./configure -confirm-license -opensource -no-qt3support -no-xmlpatterns -no-multimedia -no-webkit -no-phonon -qpa -egl -opengl es2 -prefix /usr -debug
$ make
$ make -C src/plugins/platforms/wayland
</pre>

<p>When you run a lighthouse application you either have to
pass <code>-platform waylandgl</code> or set
the <code>QT_QPA_PLATFORM</code> environment variable
to <code>waylandgl</code>.  Lighthouse supports a number of other
window systems.  There's an XCB backend, and by
passing <code>-platform xcb</code> you can jump back and forth between
Wayland and X to compare the look and feel of the application under
Wayland and X.</p>

<h2>GTK+</h2>

<p>With GTK+ 3.0, GTK+ gained support for multiple backends at runtime
and can switch between backends in the same way Qt can with
lighthouse.  The Wayland support is on the upstream GTK+ master branch
but disabled by default.  To try GTK+ on Wayland, check out gtk+ and
pass <code>--enable-wayland</code> to configure:</p>

<pre>$ git clone git://git.gnome.org/gtk+
$ cd gtk+
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-x11-backend --enable-wayland-backend --enable-debug=yes
$ make
</pre>

<p>When both Wayland and X backends are enabled, GTK+ will default to
the X11 backend, but this can be overridden by setting the
<code>GDK_BACKEND</code> environment variable to <code>wayland</code>.</p>

<h2>Clutter</h2>

<p>The Clutter toolkit has a Wayland backend that allows it to run as
a Wayland client.  The backend is a bit out of date, but it's in the
master branch of
the <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/clutter">main repo</a> and
can be activated by passing <code>--with-flavour=wayland</code> to the
configure script.</p>

<h2>SDL</h2>

<p>Benjamin Franzke is working on a port of SDL to Wayland, it's
available in
his <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~bnf/sdl-wayland/">sdl-wayland
repo</a> on freedesktop.org.</p>
