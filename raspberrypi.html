<h2>Weston on Raspberry Pi</h2>

<p>This is a guide for installing Weston into
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>. All commands and
compiling are done directly on the Pi. In Raspbian, it is recommended to
run Weston as the user 'pi', as Raspbian seems to allow input device access
mostly for this user while logged in locally (not via ssh).</p>

<p>However, if you just want to try Weston and not build it, there are
packages.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>Raspbian packages</h3>

<p>There are pre-built Wayland and Weston packages for the
<a href="http://www.raspbian.org/">Raspbian</a> distribution.</p>

<p>Add the following line to <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> file:</p>
<pre>    deb http://raspberrypi.collabora.com wheezy rpi
</pre>
<p>Then just issue:</p>
<pre>    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install weston</pre>

<p>This will install also a script called <tt>weston-launch</tt>
(not the real <tt>weston-launch</tt> program), which will automatically
set up <tt>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</tt> for you and run <tt>weston</tt>.
Running Weston with this package is as simple as:</p>
<pre>    weston-launch</pre>
<p>No need to manually set up environment variables. The firmware notes
below are still worth checking, though.</p>
</blockquote>


<h2>Build dependencies</h2>

<p>Assuming you are using the Raspbian distribution, install the
build dependencies:</p>
<pre>    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential automake libtool bison flex \
    xutils-dev libcairo2-dev libffi-dev libmtdev-dev libjpeg-dev \
    libudev-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxcursor-dev libraspberrypi-dev
</pre>

<h2>Firmware</h2>

<p>You may need the latest Raspberry Pi firmware, which you can get with the
<a href="https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update">rpi-update</a> tool. A too
old firmware may cause rpi-backend to malfunction on Raspberry Pi. Running
<tt>rpi-update</tt> will overwrite files installed by some raspbian packages
like libraspberrypi-dev. You can safely try Weston without <tt>rpi-update</tt>
first, but if you encounter graphics problems, see if it fixes them.</p>

<p>You may want to tweak the following options in
<tt>/boot/config.txt</tt>:</p>
<dl>
	<dt><tt>gpu_mem=128</tt></dt>
	<dd>How much memory to reserve for the VideoCore, i.e. framebuffers,
	GL textures, Dispmanx resources.</dd>
	<dt><tt>dispmanx_offline=1</tt></dt>
	<dd>This will enable the firmware to fall back to off-line
	compositing of Dispmanx elements. Normally the compositing
	is done on-line, during scanout, but cannot handle too many
	elements. With off-line enabled, an off-screen buffer
	is allocated for compositing. When scene complexity
	(number and sizes of elements) is high, compositing will
	happen off-line into the buffer. <b>Heavily recommended.</b></dd>
</dl>

<h2>Setting up the environment</h2>

<p>Here we will install to the home directory of the pi user.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>export WLD="$HOME/local"
export PATH="$WLD/bin:$PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$WLD/lib:/opt/vc/lib"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$WLD/lib/pkgconfig/:$WLD/share/pkgconfig/"
export ACLOCAL="aclocal -I $WLD/share/aclocal"
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR="/run/shm/wayland"
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$WLD/etc"
export XORGCONFIG="$WLD/etc/xorg.conf"

mkdir -p "$WLD/share/aclocal"
mkdir -p "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR"
chmod 0700 "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You may put the above in a script and source it in the terminal
where you wish to build the packages or run Weston.</p>

<h2>pkg-config files</h2>

<p>Some libraries on the Pi do not have appropriate pkg-config files
installed. We need to install them.</p>

<p>Download the .pc files from
<a href="http://cgit.collabora.com/git/user/pq/android-pc-files.git/tree/pkgconfig?h=raspberrypi">git://git.collabora.co.uk/git/user/pq/android-pc-files.git</a>
and make sure you take the <em>raspberrypi</em> branch. The master branch
contains similar files for Android, and will not work.</p>

<p>Copy the .pc files into <tt>$WLD/share/pkgconfig/</tt>:</p>
<pre>    $ cp bcm_host.pc egl.pc glesv2.pc $WLD/share/pkgconfig/
</pre>

<h2>Wayland libraries</h2>

<p>Libwayland is built and installed the same way as in
<a href="building.html">the generic build guide</a>.</p>

<pre>    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland
    $ cd wayland
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD --disable-documentation
    $ make
    $ make install
</pre>
<p>The <tt>--disable-documentation</tt> makes it not require Doxygen.</p>

<h2>libxkbcommon</h2>

<p>Libxkbcommon is built and installed the same way as in
<a href="building.html">the generic build guide</a>, too.</p>

<pre>    $ git clone git://people.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libxkbcommon.git
    $ cd libxkbcommon/
    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD
    $ make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>


<h2>Weston and demo applications</h2>

<p>Weston is configured slightly differently compared to the normal build:</p>
<pre>    $ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston
    $ cd weston

    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$WLD --disable-setuid-install \
    --disable-x11-compositor --disable-drm-compositor \
    --disable-fbdev-compositor --disable-wayland-compositor \
    --disable-weston-launch --disable-simple-egl-clients --disable-egl \
    --disable-libunwind --disable-colord --disable-resize-optimization \
    --disable-xwayland-test \
    WESTON_NATIVE_BACKEND="rpi-backend.so"

    $ make
    $ make install
</pre>

<p>If you decide to use the <tt>--disable-wayland-compositor</tt>
flag supplied above you can remove the dummy <tt>wayland-egl.pc</tt>
pkg-config file which you may have installed from following an older
version of this guide. Removing this file makes sure, that toytoolkit
(Weston demo programs) does not use Cairo EGL. EGL does not work for
clients due to the EGL Wayland platform being unimplemented on the
Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Weston should work by running <tt>weston</tt>. Remember to have the
environment set up, and it is useful to have an ssh session open to your
RPi on the first try, in case Weston cannot open any input or output
devices. It is best to try as the user 'pi' on Raspbian.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3>Missing <tt>bcm_host.pc</tt></h3>

<pre>checking for RPI_BCM_HOST... no
configure: WARNING: Raspberry Pi BCM host libraries not found, will use stubs instead.
</pre>

<p>If the right pkg-config files are not installed, building weston can
fail. If you see the above during Weston's configure step, the
<tt>bcm_host.pc</tt> file was not found, and the rpi-backend will not
work. The following is what you should see:</p>
<pre>checking for RPI_BCM_HOST... yes</pre>

<h3>Build error: <tt>undefined reference to `wl_egl_...</tt></h3>

<p>Somehow, cairo-egl is getting used, when it should not. Remove the
dummy <tt>wayland-egl.pc</tt>, and make sure
<tt>--disable-wayland-compositor</tt> is in the configure line. When
everything is right, you should see:</p>
<pre>checking for CAIRO_EGL... no
configure: WARNING: clients will use cairo image, cairo-egl not used</pre>


<h3>Some or all surfaces (graphics) are corrupted</h3>

<p>Too old firmware might cause corrupted graphics.
Try upgrading the firmware, and try the <tt>/boot/config.txt</tt>
options mentioned above.</p>

<h3>Monitor or TV goes blank, loses signal, etc.</h3>

<p>You probably do not have <tt>dispmanx_offline=1</tt> for the firmware.
When there are too many things on screen for the on-line compositor to
handle, the output dies or becomes corrupt without the off-line fallback.</p>

<h3>Some windows or the whole image flickers</h3>

<p>There may be so many things on screen, that even the off-line compositor
in the firmware cannot keep up. Try to close some windows.</p>

<h3>Programs are dying on SIGBUS</h3>

<p>Most likely you are running out of space in <tt>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</tt>.
This is where Wayland programs allocate their pixel buffers.</p>
